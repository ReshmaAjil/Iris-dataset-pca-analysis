# Iris-dataset-pca-analysis
Dimensionality reduction and visualization of the Iris dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in Python. Includes 2D scatter plots of PC1 vs PC2 and insights on species separation.
Overview
This repository demonstrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the classic Iris dataset. PCA is used to reduce the dataset’s 4-dimensional feature space into 2 dimensions for visualization and exploratory data analysis.
The project includes:
Standardization of features
PCA transformation to 2 principal components (PC1 & PC2)
2D scatter plot visualizing species separation
Interpretation of variance captured by each component
Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers:
Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica
Each sample has 4 features:
Sepal length (cm)
Sepal width (cm)
Petal length (cm)
Petal width (cm)
Key Insights
PC1 and PC2 capture the majority of the dataset variance (~95%).
Setosa species is clearly separable from the others.
Versicolor and Virginica overlap slightly, reflecting feature similarity.
PCA helps in visualizing high-dimensional datasets and preparing data for machine learning models.
